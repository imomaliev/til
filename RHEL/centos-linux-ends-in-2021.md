# CentOS Linux project ends in 2021

## Issue
I was having problems setting up CentOS 8 and stumbled upon that CentOS 8 ends in 2021 instead of 2029

## Solution
Use CentOS 7 until 2024.

## What I Learned
1. For some internal reason RHEL decided to stop funding CentOS Linux and only fund CentOS Stream.

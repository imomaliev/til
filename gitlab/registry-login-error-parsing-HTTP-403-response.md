# Registry login error

## Issue
Sometimes error messages very hard to understand
```console
$ docker login registry.gitlab.com
Authenticating with existing credentials...
Login did not succeed, error: Error response from daemon: Get https://registry.gitlab.com/v2/: error parsing HTTP 403 response body: unexpected end of JSON input: ""
```

## Resolution
After digging through search results which weren't relevant and didn't help I found this
[https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207509](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207509)

Turns out the issue was due to IP blocking. VPN solved this without problem.

## What I Learned

1. If you have 2FA enabled your regular login and password wouldn't work.
   > If you have Two-Factor Authentication enabled, use a Personal Access Token instead of a password.

2. "Itâ€™s Always DNS"

# Commit short sha length

## Issue
I was trying to match local build behavior to gitlab's one. In gitlab CI there is predifined variable called `CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA` which has a value of first 8 characters of current commit. To get "short" version of current commit you could run
```console
$ git rev-parse --short HEAD
e0c8af0
```
But this gives you only 7. First of all why it is 7 and how to get 8?

## Solution
1. You could pass `{n}` to `--short`.

   > --short[=length]
   >        Same as --verify but shortens the object name to a unique prefix with at least length characters. The minimum length is 4, the default is the
   >        effective value of the core.abbrev configuration variable (see git-config(1)).

   ```console
   $ git rev-parse --short=8 HEAD
   e0c8af03
   ```
1. There is `core.abbrev` setting for git config.
   
   > core.abbrev
   >        Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If unspecified or set to "auto", an appropriate value is computed based on the approximate number
   >        of packed objects in your repository, which hopefully is enough for abbreviated object names to stay unique for some time. The minimum length is 4.

   ```console
   $ git config core.abbrev 8
   ```

## What I Learned
1. 7 is somewhat default for many programms

   > core.abbrev
   >        Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If unspecified, many commands
   >        abbreviate to 7 hexdigits, which may not be enough for abbreviated object names to
   >        stay unique for sufficiently long time.

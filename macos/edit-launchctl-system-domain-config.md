# How to edit launchctl system domain configs

## Issue

I messed up my launchctl configs while I was trying to disable FortiClient from starting on startup. I tried to use `launchctl disable ...` for services but ended up adding wrong entries to disable configuration.

## Solution

Edit `/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled*` files and delete wrong data

## What I Learned

1. How to login to single-user mode on macOS.

   > Press `Command-S` on system boot

1. Make data editable because in single user it is mounted as readonly

   In single-user mode run

   ```console
   $ cd /
   $ mount -uw /System/Volumes/Data
   ```

1. After macOS Catalina launched the mount mechanism changed and split between system data and user data. This why now we use `mount ...` from previous point, but before that you mounted whole system

   ```console
   $ /sbin/mount -uw /
   ```

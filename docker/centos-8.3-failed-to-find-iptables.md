# CentOS 8.3 failed to find iptables

## Issue

Trying to install docker on CentOS 8.3, but for some reason systemd kept giving me errors

```console
$ systemctl status docker.service
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: activating (auto-restart) (Result: exit-code) since Thu 2021-02-25 04:59:07 UTC; 918ms ago

```

And

```console
$ journalctl -xe

## Solution

Install iptables

```console
dnf install iptables
```

## What I Learned

1. `iptables` is bolted into docker internals
   https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26824
1. When installing iptables in CentOS 8 it actually installs shim script which converts `iptables`'s commands to `nf_tables`
1. Many Linux distros moving to nf_tables
